# Predicting Movie Quality

I analyze what makes good/bad IMDb movies using R. This was my final project from the "PSTAT 131 - Data Mining" class I took at UC Santa Barbara in Winter quarter 2017.

## Getting Started

Here are descriptions of files in this project:

* **movie_metadata.csv** is the dataset I used. Originally taken from Kaggle, but it is no longer there.
* **final_project.rmd** is the RMarkdown file which contains all the work I did. This is used to generate **final_report.pdf** and **final_report.html**
  - **final_project.pdf** is the PDF output of my report generated using **final_project.rmd**
  - **final_project.html** is the HTML output of my report generated using **final_project.rmd**
